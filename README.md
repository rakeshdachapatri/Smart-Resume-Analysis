Resume-Screening-and-Job-Recommendation
Companies often receive thousands of resumes for each job posting and employ dedicated screening officers to screen qualified candidates. Finding suitable candidates for an open role from a database of 1000s of resumes can be a tough task. Automated resume categorization can speeden the candidate selection process.

Resume Classification and Job Matching System
Overview
In todayâ€™s fast-paced recruitment market, companies receive an overwhelming number of resumes across various fields and specializations. The traditional methods of classifying resumes are time-consuming and inefficient. This project aims to develop a model that automates the extraction and classification of resumes, ultimately matching candidates with suitable job opportunities.

Features
Resume Parsing: Extracts text from resumes in PDF format using Python libraries such as pdfminer or PyPDF2.
Data Structuring: Converts unstructured resume data into a structured format for easier analysis.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implements classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms to determine the best job matches for candidates.
User-Friendly Output: Displays the most suitable job opportunities for candidates based on their extracted skills and experiences.
Technologies Used
Python
Libraries:
pdfminer or PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction
scikit-learn for machine learning
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical operations
